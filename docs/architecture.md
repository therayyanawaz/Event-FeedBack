# Event Feedback Chatbot Architecture

This document outlines the architecture and design decisions for the Event Feedback Chatbot.

## System Overview

The Event Feedback Chatbot is designed as a modern web application using React and Next.js, with a MongoDB database for data persistence. The architecture follows a component-based approach with clear separation of concerns.

## Core Components

### 1. User Interface Layer

The UI consists of React components that handle the presentation and user interaction:

- **Chat Component**: The main interface that displays messages and handles user input
- **Message Component**: Renders individual chat messages with appropriate styling
- **UserInput Component**: Captures and validates user input

### 2. Application Layer

This layer contains the business logic and manages the flow of data:

- **API Routes**: Handle communication between the frontend and the backend
- **Chat Logic**: Manages conversation flow, processes user responses
- **Feedback Collection**: Validates and stores feedback data

### 3. Data Layer

Responsible for data persistence and retrieval:

- **Database Connection**: Manages MongoDB connection
- **Data Models**: Define the structure for events, feedback, and conversations
- **Data Queries**: Retrieve and update data in the database

## Data Flow

1. **User Interaction**:
   - User enters feedback through the chat interface
   - Input is validated and passed to the application layer

2. **Processing**:
   - The application processes the input based on the current state of the conversation
   - Determines the next question or response based on the conversation flow

3. **Persistence**:
   - User responses are temporarily stored in memory during the conversation
   - Complete feedback is saved to the database when the conversation concludes

4. **Analytics**:
   - Feedback data can be analyzed to generate insights
   - Reports can be generated for event organizers

## Conversation Flow

The conversation flow is designed as a state machine with predefined questions and adaptive paths:

1. **Greeting**: Initial welcome message and introduction
2. **Question Sequence**: A series of questions about different aspects of the event
3. **Adaptive Questioning**: Follow-up questions based on previous responses (e.g., asking for specifics on low ratings)
4. **Conclusion**: Thanking the user and confirming the feedback has been recorded

## Scalability Considerations

The system is designed to scale with increasing numbers of users and events:

- **Stateless API**: API routes are designed to be stateless, allowing for horizontal scaling
- **Database Indexing**: Key fields are indexed for efficient queries
- **Connection Pooling**: Database connections are pooled for efficient resource usage
- **Caching**: Frequently accessed data can be cached to reduce database load

## Security Measures

- **Input Validation**: All user inputs are validated before processing
- **Data Sanitization**: Prevent injection attacks by sanitizing inputs
- **Environment Variables**: Sensitive information is stored in environment variables
- **API Rate Limiting**: Prevent abuse through rate limiting on API routes

## Future Extensions

The architecture is designed to accommodate future enhancements:

1. **NLP Integration**: Add natural language processing for better understanding of free-text responses
2. **Multi-language Support**: Add internationalization for supporting multiple languages
3. **Integration APIs**: Allow integration with popular event management platforms
4. **Advanced Analytics**: Implement sentiment analysis and trend detection
5. **Customizable Question Flow**: Allow event organizers to define their own question sequences
